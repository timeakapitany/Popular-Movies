# Popular-Movies
This is a movie app using The MovieDataBase API.

The app displays the most popular movies using the /movie/popular API via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails.
With a settings menu, sorting can be changed to highest rated movies using the /movie/top_rated API.

Movis can be tapped to view more details of it (title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis).
Third party library (Picasso) is used only for image loading.

For the API key, create a string resource with name: api_key
