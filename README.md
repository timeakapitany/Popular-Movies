# Popular-Movies
This is a movie app using The MovieDataBase API.

The app displays the most popular movies using the /movie/popular API via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails.
With a settings menu, sorting can be changed to highest rated movies using the /movie/top_rated API, or to favorites using a local movies collection.

Movies can be tapped to view more details of it (title, release date, movie poster, vote average, plot synopsis); make a movie favorite or  unfavorite it; read reviews or watch trailers.

For the API key, create a string resource with name: api_key
